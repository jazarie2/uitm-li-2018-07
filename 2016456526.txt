meet an error after trying to reopen cakephp using wamp:
(Sorry,

There is an error.

There is Wampserver path (c:/wamp64)
into Windows PATH environnement variable: (C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.4)

It seems that a PHP installation is declared in the environment variable PATH
C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.4

Wampserver does not use, modify or require the PATH environment variable.
Using a PATH on Wampserver or PHP version
is detrimental to the proper functioning of Wampserver.)

Deleted the path but still cannot open cakephp.
So I decided to use XAMPP back.
will learn cakephp tommorow
